    "Error-Correcting Output Codes(ECOC) is an ensemble method designed for\n",
    "multi-class classification problem. In multi-class classification problem, the task\n",
    "is to decide one label from $k > 2$ possible choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in digit recognition task, we need to map each hand written digit to one of $k = 10$ classes.\n",
    "Some algorithms, such as decision tree, naive bayes and neural network, can\n",
    "handle multi-class problem directly.\n",

    "${1, 3, 5, 7, 9}$. Thus 15 binary classifiers are trained in this way. To classify a\n",

    "Notice that in the error-correcting output code, the rows have more bits than\n",

    "Besides, random generation of the codewords is a recommended method by the reference [http://www.jair.org/vol/vol2.html](\"Solving  multiclass  learning  problem  via  error-correcting  output codes,\" Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, vol. 2, pp. 263–286, 1995.)\n",

    "We formulate this as a propositional satisability problem and apply the GSAT algorithm (Selman,Levesque, &Mitchell,1992) to attempt a solution. A solution is required to include exactly $L$ columns(the desired length of the code) while ensuring that the Hamming distance between every two columns is between $d$ and $L$ exclusion constraint is placed between any two columns that violate the column separation condition. To support these constraints, we\n",

To improve them,the algorithm repeatedly finds the pair of rows closest together in Hamming distance and the pair of columns that have the \"most extreme\" Hamming distance (i.e.,either too close or too far apart). The algorithm then computes the four codeword bits where these rows and columns intersect and changes them to improve the row and column separations as shown in the below figure. When this hill-climbing procedure reaches a local maximum, the algorithm randomly chooses pairs of rows and columns and tries to improve their separations. This combined hill-climbing/random-choice procedure is able to improve the minimum Hamming distance separation quite substantially.\n",

    "For $k>11$ we can also applied the BCH algorithm to design codes (Bose & Ray-Chaudhuri, 1960;Hocquenghem,1959). The BCH algorithm employs algebraic methods from Galois field theory to design nearly optimal error-correcting codes. However, there are three practical drawbacks to using this algorithm. First, published tables of the primitive polynomials required by this algorithm only produce codes up to length 64, since this is the largest word size employed in computer\n",
    "memories. Second, the codes do not always exhibit good column separations. Third, the number of rows in these codes is\n",
